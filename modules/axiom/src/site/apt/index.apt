           Apache Axiom - The XML Object Model
           -----------------------------------

Welcome to Apache Axiom

  AXIOM stands for AXis Object Model (also known as OM - Object Model) and refers to the XML
  infoset model that was initially developed for Apache Axis2. XML infoset refers to the
  information included inside the XML and for programmatical manipulation it is convenient
  to have a representation of this XML infoset in a language specific manner. For an object
  oriented language the obvious choice is a model made up of objects. DOM and JDOM are two
  such XML models. OM is conceptually similar to such an XML model by its external behavior
  but deep down it is very much different.

  Apache AXIOM is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand building
  of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
  building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built in support for XML
  Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data
  efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use API with a very
  high performant architecture!

  Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache AXIOM is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a pure
  standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.
