         Axiom 1.3 roadmap
        -------------------

Introduction

  This page summarizes the planned changes for the next major release, i.e. Axiom 1.3.
  Note that it is not intended as a wish list for new features, but identifies a set of
  changes that break backward compatibility and therefore need to
  be postponed to the 1.3 release.

  The overall goals for the 1.3 are:
  
   * Upgrade the API to Java 5, i.e. make use of generics.
   
   * Eliminate deprecated APIs and utility classes.
   
   * Eliminate remaining API inconsistencies.
   
   * Make the API more compact by clarifying the separation between the public API
     and implementation classes and moving implementation classes out of <<<axiom-api>>>.
   
API inconsistencies to be eliminated

* Usage of <<<Object>>> instead of <<<DataHandler>>>

  There are several APIs that use <<<Object>>> although they expect or return
  a <<<DataHandler>>>. This is probably a legacy of Axis 1.x where the Activation API
  was an optional dependency. Today this no longer makes sense:
  
   * The Activation API is included in Java 6.
   
   * It is unlikely that Axiom actually works if Activation is not in the class path
     because there is nothing in the build that enforces or tests that and there are no
     known downstream projects that use Axiom without also depending on the Activation API.
  
  The following APIs will be changed to use <<<DataHandler>>> directly:
  
   * <<<OMText#getDataHandler()>>>
   
   * <<<OMFactory#createOMText(Object, boolean)>>>

* Methods declared by the wrong interface in the node type hierarchy

  Some methods are declared at the wrong level in the node type hierarchy so that they may
  be called on nodes for which they are not meaningful:
  
   * The <<<serialize>>> and <<<serializeAndConsume>>> methods that take an <<<OutputStream>>>
     or <<<Writer>>> object are only meaningful for <<<OMContainer>>> objects. However, they
     are declared by <<<OMNode>>>. Note that already in 1.2.x, these methods are deprecated.
   
   * <<<OMContainer>>> declares several methods that return child elements by name: <<<getChildrenWithLocalName>>>,
     <<<getChildrenWithName>>>, <<<getChildrenWithNamespaceURI>>> and <<<getFirstChildWithName>>>.
     Since the document element is unique, these methods are not meaningful for <<<OMDocument>>>
     and they should be declared by <<<OMElement>>> instead.
