                            This is the StAX implementation that Axiom uses by default.

                            The reference implementation was written by BEA and is available as Maven artifact

                            Note that the JAR doesn't contain the necessary files to enable service discovery.
                            Geronimo's implementation of the StAX API library will not be able to locate
                            the reference implementation unless the following system properties are set:
