Contains utility classes to work with binary data. They are typically used to store
data temporarily and often provide a better alternative than using
{@link java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream} and {@link java.io.ByteArrayInputStream}.

Note that the API in this package is new in 1.2.9 and may undergo some changes in
subsequent releases. Please use with care!
