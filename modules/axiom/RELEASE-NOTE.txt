     Apache AXIOM 1.1.1 Release Note

===========================================

http://ws.apache.org/commons/axiom

Note : AXIOM 1.1 release was compiled in JDK1.5. But AXIOM has a minimum requirement for it to have jdk 1.4 compatible
distributable. This is a minor release, which has all the features in AXIOM 1.1 but compiles in JDK 1.4.

Apache AXIOM is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand building
of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built-in support for XML
Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data
efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these results in a easy to use API with a very
high performant architecture!

Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache AXIOM (AXIs Object Model)is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a pure
standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.
