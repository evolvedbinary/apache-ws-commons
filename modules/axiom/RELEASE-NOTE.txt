     Apache AXIOM 1.1.1 Release Note

===========================================

http://ws.apache.org/commons/axiom

NOTE: This is a bug-fix release: AXIOM 1.1 release was compiled in JDK1.5, when we have a minimum requirement of jdk 1.4 compatible
distributables. There are no new features or fixes in this release other than being compiled on JDK 1.4. The original release note follows.

Apache AXIOM is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand building
of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built-in support for XML
Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data
efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these results in a easy to use API with a very
high performant architecture!

Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache AXIOM (AXIs Object Model)is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a pure
standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.
