<body lang="en">
<h2>Welcome to Apache Axiom</h2>

<p>AXIOM stands for AXis Object Model (also known as OM - Object Model) and refers to the XML
    infoset model that is initialy developed for Apache Axis2. XML infoset refers to the information
    included inside the XML and for programmatical manipulation it is convenient to have a
    representation of this XML infoset in a language specific manner. For an object oriented
    language the obvious choice is a model made up of objects. DOM and JDOM are two such XML models.
    OM is conceptually similar to such an XML model by its external behavior but deep down it is
    very much different. </p>

<h2>Latest Release</h2>

<h3>02 May 2006 - Apache Axiom Version 1.0 Released!</h3>

<p>(<a href="http://ws.apache.org/commons/axiom/download.cgi">Download 0.95</a>)</p>

<p>After nearly 2 years of development and numerous incremental releases, we are proud to announce
    the release of Version 1.0 of Apache AXIOM!

    Apache AXIOM is a StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model which supports on-demand
    building of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn
    off the tree building and directly access the underlying pull event stream. It also has built in
    support for XML Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry
    binary data efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use
    API with a very high performant architecture!

    Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache AXIOM is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a
    pure standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache
    Axis2. </p>
