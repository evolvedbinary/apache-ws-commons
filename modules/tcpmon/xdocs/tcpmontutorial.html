<h1>TCPMon Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TCPMon is a utility that allows the user to monitor the messages passed
along in TCP based conversation. It is based on a swing ui and works on
almost all paltforms that Java supports. The aim of this simple tutorial is
to explain how TCPMon works and also to explain some of its features.</p>

<h2>Structure and Dependancies</h2>

<p>TCPMon has absolutely no dependancies on third party libraries. But some
of the UI features rely on JDK 1.4 so TCPMon needs a JRE that is 1.4 or
higher.</p>

<h2>Usage Patterns</h2>

<h3>As an Explicit Intermediate</h3>

<p>The most common usage pattern for the TCPMon is as an intermediary. It is
called explicit since the client has to point to the intermediary rather than
the original endpoint in order to monitor the messages. The following figure
explains the concept of this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In order to start the TCPMon in this configuration one has to provide the
host name and the port for the listener in the admin screen.</p>

<p><img alt="first screen" src="images/screen1.jpg"></p>

<p>pressing the add button opens up a new tab that allows the messages to be
seen as in the following screen</p>

<p><img alt="message screen" src="images/screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>At this point the requester should point to the listen port of the TCPMon
instead of the original endpoint. Let us understand this with an example.</p>

<p>Say all messages passed between www.apache.org needs to be monitored.</p>

<p><strong>step 1</strong> - Add a listener with host as www.apache.org and
port as 80. set the listener to port 8080 which may be any unused port in the
local machine</p>

<p><strong>step 2</strong> - point the browser to localhost:8080 instead of
www.apache.org.</p>

<p><img alt="browser address bar" src="images/screen2-browser.jpg"></p>

<p>Once the messages start flowing they can be seen in the relevant tab.</p>

<p>The bottom controls allow the messages to be XML formatted (useful in
debugging web services), save and resend the messages and also to switch the
layout of the message windows.</p>

<h3>As a Request Sender for Web Services </h3>

<p>TCPMon can also be used as a request sender for web services. The request
SOAP message can be pasted on the send screen and then sent directly to the
server </p>

<p></p>

<h3>As a Proxy</h3>

<p>TCPMon can act as a proxy. To start the TCPMon at proxy mode, just select
the proxy option from the radio buttons.</p>

<p><img alt="proxy" src="images/screen5.jpg"></p>

<p>when acting as a proxy, TCPMon only needs the listener port to be
configured.</p>

<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>

<h3>Slow Connection Simulation</h3>

<p>TCPMon can simulate a slow connection, in which case the delay and the
bytes to be dropped can be configured. This is specially useful in testing
web services.</p>

<h3>HTTP Proxy support</h3>

<p>If HTTP proxy support is required then that can also be set in the admin
screen</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>TCPMon is a simple and easy to use tool that has many benifits when
developing message driven applications. It is particulary useful in
developing web services</p>
