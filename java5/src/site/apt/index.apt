About Apache WS Common Java 5 Classes

        This is a small collection of classes, which are part of
        the Java 5 Core. In other words, you do not need this
        library, if you are running Java 5, or later. The Java 5
        classes are used by projects like Apache JaxMe, Apache
        XML-RPC, or the the ws-common-utils.
